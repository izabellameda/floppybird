# Floppy Bird 
Welcome to Floppy Bird, the clone of the hit game, Flappy Bird. I followed the tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjcN1EyupaQkz5Olxzwvo1OzDNaNLGWoJ)

In my Floppy Bird game, the main goal is to get passed as many pipes as possible without hitting them, ending the game. Move the bird along by left-clicking the mouse, going through the gaps of the pipes. When hit, the player can restart by clicking the restart button that resets them at score 0. 

The game functions like the actual game, without the leaderboard or best score. All credit to Coding with Russ for the images and codealong.
